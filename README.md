# Data Pipeline for British Airways Data

## Overview
This project entails the development of a robust data pipeline to process and analyze British Airways data using SQL, enabling stakeholders to derive valuable insights for strategic decision-making. The pipeline is designed to handle batch data ingestion, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Data Ingestion**: Batch data is loaded into Azure Blob Storage for secure and efficient storage.
- **Transformation with Azure Databricks**: Azure Databricks is utilized for data transformation, enabling complex SQL-based manipulations and enrichment.
- **Pipeline Development**: A scalable and reliable pipeline is implemented in Snowflake using SQL, orchestrating the seamless extraction of data from Azure Blob Storage and loading it into a custom database within Snowflake.
- **Notification Integration**: A notification integration system is integrated to continuously monitor data sources for changes and trigger pipeline execution automatically.

## Project Structure
- **data_pipeline.sql**: SQL script containing code for the data pipeline implementation.
- **notification_integration.sql**: SQL script implementing the notification integration system.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and its components.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Connect to Snowflake using your preferred SQL client.
3. Execute the SQL scripts (`data_pipeline.sql` and `notification_integration.sql`) to deploy and run the data pipeline and notification integration system.

## Dependencies
- Snowflake (for SQL execution)
- Azure Blob Storage (for data storage)
- Azure Databricks (for data transformation)
